# MedParser Shiny App

This repository contains a Shiny application and supporting scripts for analyzing high-resolution lever pressing and licking data generated from operant oral ethanol/sucrose self-administration studies using the sipper tube model. The app is built around the `medparser` R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medparser), which provides standardized functions for extracting session-level and time series data from .txt files, as generated from an operant self-administration session.

## üîç Overview

The sipper model allows for the dissociation of appetitive and consummatory behaviors in rodent models of alcohol use. This app enables researchers to upload and analyze operant data, visualize cumulative records, and extract key behavioral metrics using a reproducible and standardized workflow. Importantly, the functions in `medparser` can be used to analyze data beyond that generated from the sipper model (see publications below). 

## üì¶ Features

- Upload and parse self-administration data
- Visualize cumulative lever press and lick curves
- Extract session-level behavioral metrics
- Export cleaned and summarized data
  
## üìÅ Example Data

This repository includes example data in the `example_data/` folder. These files can be used to test the app and explore its features.

To load the example data:
1. Launch the app.
2. Use the file upload panel to select a file from `example_data/`.
3. Explore the visualizations and metrics generated by the app.

To employ the response requirement (single fixed ratio) approach in your experiments, we have shared our Med-PC file in the `medpc_code/` folder, as well. 

## Version

## Change Log
- 1.0.0: alpha build

## ü§ù Contributing
You're welcome to use, adapt, and build on this project as needed. This app was specifically developed to enhance the ability of our lab to analyze data systematically, but your lab/project might have its own needs. If you find bugs or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
